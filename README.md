# CEN3031 Semester Project: TaskAru

TaskAru is a scheduling/tasking application designed to allow its users to plan out and keep track of how they spend their days, weeks, and even months. TaskAru users will be able to mark, log, and differentiate important events in a calendar and will receive notifications when those events are near. Along with this, users can share their schedules with other users and view whether they have overlaps or if they are both free to coordinate an event.
